it.



what is class?

What is object?

What is difference between path and classpath variables?

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A. No, you cannot instantiate from an Interface nor can you in an Abstract class.  One must inherit subclasses from
it and create objects of the subclass.



What is Access Specifier?
A. A Access Specifier helps to restrict the scope or visibility of the package.


What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. It stands for Object-oriented programming.  There are classes, objects, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism and
encapsulation.  Classes are user-defined data and is the main building block of object oriented programming.  Objects
are instances with attributes and behaviors. Abstraction hides the background details. Polymorphism allows for the
use of the same function with different signatures. Encapsulation is binding up the data in a single unit and
inheritance is the ability to inherit the properties of one class to another.


What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. A Java Package is a group of similar types of interfaces, classes and subclasses.  The Java.lang package is imported

A. API is Application Programming Interface. I've used IntelliJ and Eclipse so far.



Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A. No, because it causes a diamond problem where two classes inherit from the grandparent class.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A. It is when a class has more than one method of the same name with different parameters.



Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A. Exceptions are things that occur when there is a disruption with the normal flow of the program's instructions.
One can put the code in the try block.


What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods?
A. That particular type belongs to itself, so, one instance for that static member is shared for all instances .
When a variable is static, it means that its lifetime is the entire run of the program. When a method is static,
it belongs to a class, but does  not belong to an instance of that class.


What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A.  A final is a keyword used to restrict a class, variable and a method.

A. the keyword, the block and the method respectfully.  Also the access modifier, exception handling and the clean up
process respectfully.

A. A special method used to initialize objects.



Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A. Yes, as long as the parameters are not the same.



If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A. You get a default constructor.  For example, int gets a 0.


What is "this" keyword in java ?

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A. JRE implements JVM and contains all the librares that JVM uses.\


What is compile time and run time?
A. Compile time is when the programming gets converted to machine code.  Runtime is the phase of the program lifecycle

String is immutable unlike StringBuffer and StringBuilder.


What is Singleton class?
A. A class that can only have one object.


What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A. Serialization coverts and object into byte stream.  Deserialization works the opposite direction and recrates the
object in memory.

A.  Use the transient variable in serialization when you don't want to save a value of a variable .


Difference between while and do..while loop?

A. Objects reside in the Java Heap Space and when the space becomes garbage is collected.  Objects that are no longer
in usage get cleared out.


Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A. Garbage Collection does not guarantee that the program will not run out of memory.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?

A. mongodb, junit, mvn...
what is dependency injection in java?
A. when an object method supplies dependencies for another object


What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A. When all information is needed at the compile time, this is called Static Binding.  During compile time, if the
compiler cannot determine all the information needed for a function, Dynamic binding happens.
