Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. Data Structure helps programmers save time while performing operations like storing, retrieving and processing data.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A. There is Array, Stacked, LinkedList and Graph


List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. It is used in database management, statistical analysis , operating system....


what is an Array?
A. A container that holds a fix number of values of a single type.



what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A. The length of an arraylist can be changed, array cannot. ArrayList can only store objects , not primitives.
Array can store both.

what is LinkedList?
A. A class and a collection of many objects of the same type.


How is an Array different from Linked List?
A. Array is a collection of elements like data type, Linked List is a collection of objects.

what is queue?
A. Queue is a collection of ordered elements.  You can store them before processing.  It is an interface available
in the Java util package.


what is stack?
A. A linear data structure that is used to store a collection of objects based on LIFO.


what is FIFO and LIFO?
A. First in First Out and Last In First Out


what is the order of complexity?
A. If the order of complexity is smaller, the program will run faster, scaling as the input gets larger.  Efficient
algorithms help to reduce order of complexity.


what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A.  If unsorted, sequential search.   If array increases in value and is sorted, binary search.


what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
what is tree in data structure?
A. hierarchical data structure of nodes


what is graph in data structure?
A. A picture of the set of objects and how they are linked


what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A.  Hashmap is non-synchronized, allows one null key and multiple null values HashTable does not allow for a null key
or null value.


What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
A. RDBMS = Array (i.e. Array of structures)
   Network data model = Graph.
   Hierarchical data model = Trees.


How HashMap works in java?
A.It uses multiple buckets that point to a single linked list where the nodes are.


What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
It occurs when someone tries to access an array element with an illegal index.



What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
A. You can iterate each element.  You can clone, array.copyOf, and copyOfRange...


What is difference between an array and a linked list?
A. A. Array is a collection of elements like data type, Linked List is a collection of objects.


What is DFS and BFS?
A. Breadth First Search and Depth First Search


What is Recursion?
A. A technique for when a function can call itself up.


What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A. Linear data structure are arranged in linear order and each element is attached to the previous one.  Non linear data
is attached by a hierarchical form.


What is Big-(O)-notation?
A. It is used to classify algorithms.  As the input grows, it will check the run-time and space requirements.



Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
A: Ω(n^2)           	θ(n^2)   ---> selection sort
    Ω(n)                θ(n^2)   --->   Insertion sort

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
